#Indoor positioning using iBeacons

This is the code for my project for the [Wireless Network](http://www.math.unipd.it/~cpalazzi/retiwireless.html) course for the Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Padova. It uses [iBeacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon) and [Multilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateration) to compute the device position using known beacon beacons.

I am the author of this code; the project was done with [MicheleCaovilla](https://github.com/MicheleCaovilla).
